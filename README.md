Steps involved for creating python environment: 

**Step 1:**  Check your computer system requirment either you want to install python in windows operating system or linux operating system. 

**Step 2:** Go to <https://www.python.org/downloads/> and check the latest version of python. I always recommends to choose the one steps lower or two step lower version of python because the latest version always have some updates or dependies which can be issue at beginers stage. So select the python verison.

**Step 3:** Install the python version on your local machine e.g Windows or Linux. 

**Step 4:** Install IDE for userinterface for programming, you can use Pycharm, Jupyternotebook, Visual studio code. 

**Step 5:** Create your first python file with .py extension and enjoy. 

```python
print("Hello World!") 
print("This is my first python program")
```
